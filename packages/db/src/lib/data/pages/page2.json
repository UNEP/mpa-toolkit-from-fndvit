The sizes of proposals vary depending on the opportunities that arise, which may change from year to year. Although most are small grants averaging US$40,000, the usual range is between US$10,000 and US$200,000. Depending on the complexity/size of a proposal, it may take 2–10 days to prepare it. The grants that require more time (5–10 days) are usually for PACT, the GEF Small Grants Programme and different programmes funded by the Mesoamerican Reef Fund (MAR Fund). TIDE is also fortunate to receive financial donations from friends – individuals who visit the protected areas and are impressed with the work of the organization.",

Each MPA has unique characteristics and will have a different set of fundraising opportunities that vary over time.  You cannot force partnerships for shared stewardship of MPAs. It takes time, patience and constant work.  Behaviour doesn’t change overnight – behaviour change is not possible without constantly engaging and empowering resource users so they gain tangible benefits from MPA management. This requires continuous fundraising. To maintain effective local partnerships and community engagement requires continued support and follow-up.  Raising funds for some activities carried out with local communities, such as supplemental income projects, is challenging. ",
