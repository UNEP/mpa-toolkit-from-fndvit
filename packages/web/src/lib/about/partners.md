# What is MPAth
MPAth is a platform designed to make marine information accessible to all seascape stakeholders, not just limited to marine protected area (MPA) management. It ensures accessibility by providing scientifically accurate content that is easy to read and load, regardless of connectivity. Developed by marine experts representing a broad spectrum of stakeholders, MPAth aims to democratize access to marine information and empower stakeholders to make informed decisions for marine conservation and management, aligning with goals from the Global Biodiversity Framework.

It is a collaborative initiative led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in partnership with the University of Queensland, The Nature Conservancy, and the World Wildlife Fund. Our global advisory group of experts and practitioners contributes valuable insights and expertise to the platform's development.
